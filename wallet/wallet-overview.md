`walletd` is the best places to store your Siacoins. It is the official wallet app made by the developers of the Sia network, the Sia Foundation.

`walletd` allows you to store Siacoins in a secure wallet. Although `walletd` is launched via command line it also has a user interface that can be accessed via web browser.

Your wallet gives you access to see your balance and transaction history, and the ability to send or receive Siacoin to any other Sia user.

Here's what the `walletd` user interface looks like.

Your **balance** is at the top. This is the current amount of Siacoins in your wallet, and can fluctuate quite a bit depending on how you use Sia. If you own any Siafunds, they show up next to this.
