# ‚úè Linux

This guide will walk you through setting up a `walletd` on Linux. At the end of this guide, you should have the following:

* **Installed Sia `walletd` software:** You should have successfully installed the Sia `walletd` software on your Linux operating system with the appropriate binary.
* **Functional Sia Wallet:** You should have a functional Sia wallet that is set up and ready for transactional use in the Sia network.
* **Basic Wallet Security:** You should have taken basic security measures, such as using a strong password for your wallet.

## Pre-requisites

* **Network Access:** `walletd` interacts with the Sia network, so you need a stable internet connection and open network access to connect to the Sia blockchain.
* **Operating System Compatibility:** Ensure that your Linux version is compatible with the walletd software. Check [releases](../../miscellaneous/releases.md) supported Linux versions.
* **System Updates:** Ensure that your Linux is up to date with the latest system updates, as these updates can contain important security fixes and improvements.

## Getting walletd

1. Download the latest version of `walletd` for your operating system from the [official website](https://sia.tech/software/walletd). For the purpose of this guide, we will download the Linux version and unzip the `walletd` binary to `/usr/local/bin`.

\<image>

```sh
unzip walletd_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv -t /usr/local/bin walletd_linux_amd64/walletd
rm -rf walletd_linux_amd64.zip 
```

...

### Accessing the UI

For users with a desktop environment, you can open a browser to `http://localhost:9980` to access the `walletd` UI.

If you do not have a desktop environment:

1. Find your server's LAN IP using `ip addr`, `ifconfig`, etc.
2. Switch to another computer in your LAN and open the browser
3. Type your LAN IP followed by `:9980` in the address bar (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:9980`)
