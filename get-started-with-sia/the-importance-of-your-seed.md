# ðŸš§ The importance of your seed

Your Sia seed is your key to your Siacoin balance, and in the future, it will be the key to your files as well. Itâ€™s the most important piece of information in your Sia experience.

## About the seed

* Itâ€™s 29 words... most of the time. There's a small chance you'll get a 28-word seed.
* It's generated when you first make your Siacoin wallet
* It will also be your wallet password unless you set a custom password
* If you have your correct seed, you can always recover your Siacoin balance.

### Loss

If you lose your seed, your Siacoin balance will be permanently inaccessible. Because Sia is truly decentralized, the Sia dev team canâ€™t access your seed at any time, for any reason.

### Theft

If someone steals your seed, they can easily steal your Siacoin balance. Be wary of giving any untrusted third party your seed.

### Keep it safe

Because your seed is so important, you should have physical and digital methods of storing it safely. As with any piece of digital information that you care about, you shouldn't consider it safe unless you have multiple independent backups.

* Store it the same way it's given to you: all lower-case letters, with a space between each word.
* Make sure there is no space at the beginning or end of the seed.

#### Physically Safe

Keep a laminated paper copy stored in a locked safe or a bank safety deposit box.

#### Digitally Safe

Keep your seed in a password or biometric (e.g., fingerprint) secured app like 1Password or LastPass.

## Make sure it's correct

Once you write it down, copy and paste it, or re-type it, ensure you've done so correctly. A single miswritten word or mistyped letter means the entire seed is incorrect and can no longer be used to unlock your wallet or recover your Siacoin.
