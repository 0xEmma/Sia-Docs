# Your Sia Seed

Your Sia Seed holds the key to your Siacoin balance access to your files as well. It stands as the cornerstone of your Sia journey and the most important piece of information in your entire Sia experience.

## About the Seed

* Sia is using BIP 39 with 128 bits of entropy and is made up of 12 words to generate your Seed.
* Your Seed is generated when you first create your Siacoin (SC) wallet in `renterd`, `hostd` or `walletd`.
* You can always recover your Siacoin balance using your Sia Seed.

## Ways of keeping your Seed safe

Ensuring the safety of your Sia seed is of utmost importance. It's crucial to follow the proper procedures for securely storing it. Just like any other valuable digital information, never rely on its safety unless you have multiple separate backups in place.

* **Use a Hardware Wallet:** Hardware wallets are considered one of the most secure methods for storing seeds, as they are offline and less susceptible to hacking.
* **Create a Paper Backup:** Write down your seed on paper and store it securely. Make multiple copies and keep them in different safe locations.
* **Use a Strong Password:** Encrypt your seed with a strong, unique password and store it separately from the seed.
* **Use a Biometric:** Keep your seed in a biometric secure app that relies on Opt into using unique physical identity verification.
* **Memorize Your Seed:** If possible, memorize your seed. However, ensure it's something you can remember accurately without writing it down.

A single incorrectly written word or mistyped letter renders the entire seed invalid, making it impossible to access your wallet or retrieve your Siacoins. Store it exactly as it was originally provided to you.

### Lost or Stolen

If you lose your seed, your Siacoin balance will become **permanently** inaccessible. Since Sia operates as a fully decentralized platform.

**The Sia development team cannot access your seed under any circumstances.**

In the unfortunate event that someone steals your seed, they will have the ability to easily abscond with your Siacoin balance. Thus, exercise utmost caution when it comes to sharing your seed with any third party that you do not fully trust.
