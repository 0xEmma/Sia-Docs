# Learn about Siacoins

## Siacoins: The Power Behind Sia Network

Siacoins (SC) are the utility tokens powering the Sia network and are essential for any activity on the network. Siacoins (SC) serve a singular purpose – facilitating network operations – yet are utilized in various ways such as:

* Uploading files to Sia, you use Siacoins to pay for storage.
* Earning Siacoins (SC) for storing others' data.
* Transferring by sending them to others or receiving them at your wallet address.

Siacoins (SC)  can be securely stored using our [official software](https://sia.tech/software/walletd), on a hardware wallet, or a paper wallet. Initially obtaining Siacoins (SC) is simple through methods such as having someone send them to you,  purchasing them on an exchange, or engaging in mining activities.

New Siacoins (SC) are created through proof-of-work mining. Currently, there are over 40 billion Siacoins in circulation, and this number will continue to increase. Sia is poised to become the foundational storage layer of the internet, necessitating billions of Siacoins to accommodate the petabytes and exabytes of data that will be stored on our platform.

## How to obtain Siacoins

Whether you want to upload files to the decentralized cloud or lend your extra storage space to the network, you need Siacoins to use Sia. Siacoins can be sent to you once you make a Sia wallet address, or you can mine them. Otherwise, you’ll need to buy them.

### Buy from an exchange

Siacoins (SC) are listed on several prominent and can access the complete list of exchanges where Siacoins (SC) are available on our [official website](https://sia.tech/community-ecosystem?software=exchanges#software). Purchasing Siacoins (SC) from an exchange typically offers competitive prices but may involve a relatively steep learning curve for new users.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some exchanges support direct fiat (local currency) to Siacoin purchases, but others require you to buy Bitcoins, Ethereum, or other cryptos to make your purchase. Please visit the exchange's official website to find out more.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
For those new to cryptocurrency purchases, it's advisable to begin with a modest amount until you feel confident and familiar with the process.
{% endhint %}

Exchange wallets may not always be the ideal choice for storing cryptocurrencies, and will not serve the intended purpose of using Sia effectively. Now that you have Siacoins (SC), you're now able to transfer them to either [`renterd`](../renting/transferring-siacoins.md), [`hostd`](../hosting/transferring-siacoins.md) or [`walletd`](../wallet/transferring-siacoins.md) Sia wallet address.&#x20;

### Receiving from others

By sharing your generated Sia wallet address, Siacoins can be sent to you in a few minutes. Ensure the full address is without any extra spaces, and provide this address to whomever you're receiving the funds from.

You can also receive Siacoins, simply share your QR code for others to scan and send funds to your wallet.

### Mining on the network

\
When you mine on a cryptocurrency network, you contribute computing power to help process and verify transactions on that network. Miners are the backbone of the network, verifying the integrity of the blockchain. On Sia, miners are rewarded with Siacoins (SC) for their services.

Our [official website](https://sia.tech/community-ecosystem?software=mining\_pools) shows a list of mining pools for Siacoins (SC). Please see their individual documentation to get started.

#### The Block Rewards

The block reward is the miner's incentive to contribute their computing power and electricity costs to the network. When a block is successfully verified, or solved, an amount of Siacoins (SC) is paid out to those who mined the block.

Unlike Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrency blockchains, the Sia block reward never stops and gives infinite rewards. This means that miners will always have an incentive to be part of Sia. Once the block reward reaches 30,000 coins, it stays there forever.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Sia network launched, the block reward was 300,000 Siacoins. This decreases by one every block, with a floor at 30,000 – which was reached at block 270,000 (300,000 - block height).
{% endhint %}

#### Proof-of-work

The Sia blockchain operates on Proof-of-Work, ensuring the integrity of transactions and contracts. Whether it's used for power cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or utility and smart storage contracts like Sia, trust is inherent in a blockchain's immutability. With no central authority to oversee transactions or contract validity, the assurance comes from the blockchain itself. Proof-of-Work serves as a robust safeguard, deterring any attempts to alter the history of the blockchain through significant effort and expense.
