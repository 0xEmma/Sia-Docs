# ðŸš§ What is Zen?

{% hint style="info" %}
The Zen testnet is a dedicated test environment, and the zSC acquired or used on the testnet holds no real-world value.

The Sia Foundation is thrilled to announce the launch of the first Sia testnet, Zenâ€”an exclusive platform designed for testing hardforks, software developments, and integrations within the Sia ecosystem. The Zen testnet offers developers, builders, and enthusiasts a secure environment to experiment and explore the capabilities of Siacoin without the risk of losing real Siacoins.

One of the notable features of the Zen testnet is the availability of zSC through the Zen Faucet. The faucet provides a convenient way to acquire zSC for testing purposes, enabling developers to conduct tests and refine their applications or integrations without financial concerns.

To facilitate a seamless testing experience, the Sia Foundation also launched a user-friendly block explorer. With the block explorer, users can dive into the intricacies of the Siacoin network, track transactions, and monitor block confirmations, gaining valuable insights into the testnet's activity.

The Zen testnet serves as an invaluable platform for builders, developers, and the community to explore the potential of the Sia network. It creates an essential space for refining ideas, testing innovations, and contributing to developing a robust Siacoin network.

To embark on your journey with the Zen testnet and access zSC for testing, visit the Zen Faucet at \[[https://zen.sia.tech/faucet](https://zen.sia.tech/faucet)] and explore the testnet's activity using the block explorer at \[[https://zen.sia.tech](https://zen.sia.tech/)].
