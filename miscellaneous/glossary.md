**Blockchain**: A distributed ledger recording all transactions and data on the Sia network.

**Block Explorer**: A tool for viewing and searching the Sia blockchain for transaction and block information.

**Burn**: The act of sending coins to an address where they cannot be retrieved, effectively removing them from circulation.

## C

**Contract**: The agreement between a renter and a host for storage services.

**Consensus Mechanism**: The method by which network participants agree on the validity of transactions.

**Collateral**: The amount of Siacoins a host is required to lock up as a guarantee when forming a file contract.

**Cryptocurrency**: A digital or virtual currency using cryptography for security and operating independently of a central authority, often utilizing blockchain technology.

**Coin**: A cryptocurrency unit representing a specific value, often divisible into smaller units (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether).

**Cryptography**: The science of securing information through encryption and decryption techniques, a fundamental component of blockchain technology.

**Circulating Supply**: The amount of cryptocurrency available to the market and in the hands of the public, excluding locked or reserved tokens.

## D

**Decentralization**: The distribution of network components across multiple hosts and locations.

**Decentralized Storage**: Sia's approach to storage, where data is distributed across many hosts instead of being stored on a central server.

**Data Privacy**: Ensuring the confidentiality and security of data stored on the Sia network.

**De-platforming**: The act of removing or restricting access to a user, organization, or content from a platform or online service, often due to policy violations or public pressure.

## E

**Encryption**: Encoding data to limit access to authorized parties is a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency security.

**Exchange Rate**: The value at which one cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another or traditional fiat currency.

**Escrow**: A service that holds cryptocurrency or other assets in trust until specific conditions in a transaction are met.

## F

**File Recovery**: The process of retrieving data from the Sia network, typically through a file contract and associated redundancy.

**File Recovery Window**: When renters can recover their data if a host goes offline.

**Fork (Blockchain)**: A change in the protocol rules of a cryptocurrency, resulting in a divergence of the blockchain into two separate chains, such as a hard or soft fork.

**Fragmentation**: The process of dividing data or information into smaller parts or fragments for efficient storage, transmission, or processing.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Hardware commonly used for cryptocurrency mining due to its suitability for complex mathematical calculations.

## H

**Host**: A computer running Sia software that offers network storage space.

**Hash Function**: A mathematical function used in Sia to convert data into a fixed-size string of characters (hash) for data integrity and security.

**Hard Fork**: A significant and non-backward-compatible change to a blockchain protocol creates two chains with distinct rules.

## I

**Incentive Structure**: The mechanism rewards hosts for providing storage space and renters for using the network while penalizing non-compliance with agreed-upon terms.

**Immutable**: The property that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust.

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: A decentralized file system that stores and shares hypermedia and other data across a peer-to-peer network.

**IP Address**: A unique numerical label assigned to devices in a computer network, used to identify and locate devices on the internet.

**ISP (Internet Service Provider)**: A company that provides access to the internet and related services to individuals and businesses.
