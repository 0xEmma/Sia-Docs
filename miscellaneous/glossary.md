# Glossary

## **A**

**Address**: An address is a string of characters used to represent a location on the blockchain, often used for sending or receiving cryptocurrency.

**Altcoin**: Altcoin is a term for any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. It stands for alternative coin.

**ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)**: ASIC is a type of hardware built specifically for cryptocurrency mining, known for its efficiency and speed.

**Atomic Swap**: Atomic Swap is a smart contract technology that allows the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another without using an intermediary.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: API is a set of rules and protocols allowing different software applications to communicate and interact.

**Algorithm**: An algorithm is a set of rules and instructions that guide the operation of a cryptocurrency network, including consensus algorithms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

## **B**

**Blockchain**: A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions and data on the Sia network.

**Block Explorer**: A block explorer is a tool that allows users to view and search the Sia blockchain for transaction and block information.

**Burn**: Burning in the context of cryptocurrencies refers to sending coins to an address they cannot be retrieved, effectively removing them from circulation.

## C

**Contract**: The agreement between a renter and a host for storage services.

**Consensus Mechanism**: The method by which network participants agree on the validity of transactions.

**Collateral**: Collateral is the amount of Siacoins a host is required to lock up as a guarantee when forming a file contract.

**Cryptocurrency**: Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central authority, typically using blockchain technology.

**Coin**: A coin is a cryptocurrency unit representing a certain value, often divisible into smaller units (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether).

**Cryptography**: Cryptography is the science of securing information through encryption and decryption techniques. It's a fundamental component of blockchain technology.

**Circulating Supply**: Circulating supply is the amount of cryptocurrency available to the market and in the hands of the public, excluding tokens that are locked or reserved.

## D

**Decentralization**: The distribution of network components across multiple hosts and locations.

**Decentralized Storage**: Sia provides decentralized storage, meaning data is distributed across many hosts rather than stored on a central server.

**Data Privacy**: Data privacy in Sia refers to the confidentiality and security of data stored on the network.

## E

**Encryption**: Encryption is the process of encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it, a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency security.

**Exchange Rate**: The exchange rate is the value at which one cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another or traditional fiat currency.

**Escrow**: Escrow is a service that holds cryptocurrency or other assets in trust until specific conditions are met in a transaction.

## F

**File Recovery**: This process involves retrieving data from the Sia network, typically using a file contract and the associated redundancy.

**File Recovery Window**: The file recovery window is when renters can recover their data if a host goes offline.

**Fork (Blockchain)**: A fork is a change in the protocol rules of a cryptocurrency, resulting in a divergence of the blockchain into two separate chains, such as a hard fork or soft fork.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A GPU is a hardware component commonly used for cryptocurrency mining, as it's well-suited for complex mathematical calculations.

## H

**Host**: A computer running the Sia software offers the network storage space.

**Hash Function**: A hash function is a mathematical function used in Sia to convert data into a fixed-size string of characters (hash) for data integrity and security.

**Hard Fork**: A hard fork is a significant and non-backward-compatible change to a blockchain's protocol, creating two separate chains with distinct rules.

## I

**Incentive Structure**: The incentive structure in Sia refers to the mechanism that rewards hosts for providing storage space and renters for using the network while penalizing non-compliance with agreed-upon terms.

**Immutable**: Immutability in blockchain refers to the property that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust.

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: IPFS is a decentralized file system designed to store and share hypermedia and other data across a peer-to-peer network.

**IP Address**: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to devices in a computer network, used to identify and locate devices on the internet.

## J

## K

## L

## M

**Miner**: A miner in Sia is responsible for adding new blocks to the Sia blockchain by solving Proof-of-Work puzzles, securing the network, and processing transactions.

**Mining**: The process of securing the Sia network and earning rewards.

**Merkle Tree**: A Merkle tree is a data structure used in Sia to verify the integrity of data stored across the network.

## N

**Node:** An instance or installation of Sia.

**Nebulous**: Nebulous is the company behind Sia and is responsible for its development and maintenance.

## O

## P

**Proof of Storage (PoSt)**: A mechanism for hosts to prove they are storing renter data.

**Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus algorithm in blockchain networks.

## Q

## R

**Renter**: A user who rents storage space from hosts on the Sia network.

**Redundancy**: Redundancy in Sia refers to the number of hosts storing a piece of data to ensure data availability and durability.

## S

**Sia**: The decentralized cloud storage platform.

**Siacoins**: The native cryptocurrency used within the Sia network.

**Siafund**: A secondary cryptocurrency representing a stake in the Sia network.

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

**Seed**: A seed is a set of words that can be used to recover a Sia wallet if lost or damaged.

**Sia Daemon**: The Sia Daemon is the background process that runs Sia and manages its core functions.

**Sia Protocol**: The Sia protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern how data is stored, retrieved, and managed on the Sia network.

## T

**Testnet**: A testnet is a separate blockchain used for testing and development purposes, allowing users to experiment without using real cryptocurrency.

**Token**: A token is a unit of value issued by a blockchain or cryptocurrency project, often used for various purposes within that ecosystem.

**Transaction**: An action or event recorded on the Sia blockchain.

## U

**User Interface (UI)**: A user interface is the graphical layout and design through which users interact with cryptocurrency wallets, Dapps, and other software.

## V

## W

**Wallet**: A software or hardware application for storing and managing Siacoins.

**Wallet Encryption**: Sia offers encryption to protect the user's wallet and funds with a passphrase.

**Web3**: Web3 is the vision of a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications (Dapps) directly.

**Withdrawal**: Withdrawal is the process of moving cryptocurrency from a wallet or exchange to an external address.
