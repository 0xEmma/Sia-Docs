**Block Explorer**: A block explorer is a tool that allows users to view and search the Sia blockchain for transaction and block information.

**Burn**: Burning in the context of cryptocurrencies refers to sending coins to an address they cannot be retrieved, effectively removing them from circulation.

## C

**Contract**: The agreement between a renter and a host for storage services.

**Consensus Mechanism**: The method by which network participants agree on the validity of transactions.

**Cryptocurrency**: Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central authority, typically using blockchain technology.

**Coin**: A coin is a cryptocurrency unit representing a specific value, often divisible into smaller units (e.g., Bitcoin, Ether).

**Cryptography**: Cryptography is the science of securing information through encryption and decryption techniques. It's a fundamental component of blockchain technology.

**Circulating Suppl**y: Circulating supply is the amount of cryptocurrency available to the market and in the hands of the public, excluding tokens that are locked or reserved.

## D

**Decentralization**: The distribution of network components across multiple hosts and locations.

**Decentralized Storage**: Sia provides decentralized storage, meaning data is distributed across many hosts rather than stored on a central server.

**Data Privacy**: Data privacy in Sia refers to the confidentiality and security of data stored on the network.

**De-platforming**: The act of removing or restricting access to a user, organization, or content from a platform or online service, often due to policy violations or public pressure.

## E

**Encryption**: Encryption is the process of encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it, a fundamental aspect of cryptocurrency security.

**Exchange Rate**: The exchange rate is the value at which one cryptocurrency can be exchanged for another or traditional fiat currency.

**Escrow**: Escrow is a service that holds cryptocurrency or other assets in trust until specific conditions are met in a transaction.

## F

**File Recovery**: This process involves retrieving data from the Sia network, typically using a file contract and the associated redundancy.

**File Recovery Window**: The file recovery window is when renters can recover their data if a host goes offline.

**Fork (Blockchain)**: A fork is a change in the protocol rules of a cryptocurrency, resulting in a divergence of the blockchain into two separate chains, such as a hard fork or soft fork.

**Fragmentation**: Fragmentation refers to the process of data or information being divided into smaller parts or fragments, often for efficient storage, transmission, or processing.

## G

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: A GPU is a hardware component commonly used for cryptocurrency mining, as it's well-suited for complex mathematical calculations.

## H

**Host**: A computer running the Sia software offers the network storage space.

**Hash Function**: A hash function is a mathematical function used in Sia to convert data into a fixed-size string of characters (hash) for data integrity and security.

**Hard Fork**: A hard fork is a significant and non-backward-compatible change to a blockchain protocol, creating two chains with distinct rules.

## I

**Incentive Structure**: The incentive structure in Sia refers to the mechanism that rewards hosts for providing storage space and renters for using the network while penalizing non-compliance with agreed-upon terms.

**Immutable**: Immutability in blockchain refers to the property that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and trust.

**IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**: IPFS is a decentralized file system designed to store and share hypermedia and other data across a peer-to-peer network.

I**P Address**: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to devices in a computer network, used to identify and locate devices on the internet.

**ISP (Internet Service Provider)**: An ISP is a company that provides access to the internet and related services to individuals and businesses.

**Merkle Tree**: A Merkle tree is a data structure used in Sia to verify the integrity of data stored across the network.

**Non-custodial**: Non-custodial refers to a cryptocurrency wallet or service where users have complete control of their private keys and funds without relying on a third party.

## N

**Node**: An instance or installation of Sia.

**Nebulous**: Nebulous is the company behind Sia and is responsible for its development and maintenance.
