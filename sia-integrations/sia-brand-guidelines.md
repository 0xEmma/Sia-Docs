# Brand Guidelines

Third-party projects constitute an integral part of the Sia ecosystem as they broaden the range of applications of Sia and enhance the network through solutions that are not actively being developed by our team.

We aim for users to discern between core and non-core projects for several reasons:

* Non-core projects often involve some level of centralization, which is entirely acceptable. Users benefit from having choices, and centralization allows for the implementation of features that are more accessible to achieve compared to those on Sia's core infrastructure.
* There's a potential for confusion where users might mistake your project for something created by the core team. Therefore, we want to ensure that users are well-informed about where to seek assistance.
* Acknowledgment of dedication to your project, and we desire to give it the recognition it deserves, allowing it to stand out prominently.

## Guidelines

These Sia brand guidelines will provide valuable assistance to those developing their project by ensuring clarity, consistency, and a clear distinction not just between other projects, but also core Sia offerings, ultimately fostering user trust and recognition.

### Official Sia assets

The official Sia assets, including our logo and wordmark in a variety of high-quality formats, can be downloaded [here](https://sia.tech/assets/official-sia-assets.zip).

{% hint style="warning" %}
We strongly recommend using any of the `built-with-sia` logo variations to showcase your integration. This logo serves as a badge of association with Sia, so feel free to incorporate it anywhere necessary to your project.
{% endhint %}

### Logo and Wordmark

The Sia Foundation strictly owns the trademark in the US and advises against using the Sia logo and wordmark directly in any capacity such as projects. To prevent confusion and misrepresentation, users are allowed only to style the original logo and wordmark.&#x20;

</div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The logo can be similar but **must** be easily differentiated from the original Sia logo and wordmark by both color and design.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Naming

The trademark name **Sia** is pronounced _“sigh-uh”_ and not _“see-ya”_.

Using the **Sia** is accepted upon naming your project, however with two restrictions:

* Naming your project solely **Sia**.
* Naming your project **Sia** and then appending a term that directly relates to our business such as **Cloud**, **Storage**, or **Backup**.

Some examples of this include **SiaStats**, **Siasync**, **SiaWiki**, and **Siamining**. These names provide a clear indication that the focus is on **Sia**.

You also have the option to craft a uniquely personalized name that reflects your identity or your creative efforts. Illustrative instances of such custom names include **Pixeldrain**, **Filebase**, and **roadie**.

### Color

Sia incorporates a variety of colors. When crafting your own logo, you can freely choose from our color palette or develop one that suits your vision.

Using the exact Sia logo or wordmark to represent your integration with Sia is accepted, but **must** remain the same colors.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We prohibit the use of the Sia logo or wordmark and changing the color.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We're eagerly anticipating what you'll create! If you have any uncertainties regarding our Sia branding guidelines, please don't hesitate to reach out via our Discord. Make sure to inform us on [Discord](https://sia.tech/discord).
