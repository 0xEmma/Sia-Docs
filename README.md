# Introduction

## Welcome to the Sia Docs!

The Sia Docs is your gateway to the remarkable world of decentralized cloud storage. Whether you're a tech-savvy enthusiast or want to explore the potential of the decentralization of cloud storage and data security, you've come to the right place!

Our documentation aims to provide a comprehensive source of information and serve as a beacon of knowledge for anyone interested in embracing the power of decentralized cloud storage.

The information in these docs has been taken from a number of sources, primarily the previous Sia Support Center and community-driven sites like the [Sia Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20180921135627/https://siawiki.tech/index), [SiaStats](https://siastats.info), and [SiaSetup](https://siasetup.info), and we aim to educate our community with what Sia has to offer!
