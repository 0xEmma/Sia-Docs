# ðŸš§ Announcing your Host

Now that your host has finished syncing, you can announce your host to the network. This will publish your host's net address and public key to the blockchain so renters can connect to your host and form contracts. The announcement transaction costs a small amount of Siacoins, which will be deducted from your wallet.

To announce your host:

1. Click the "Configuration" icon in the sidebar
2. Click the "Announce" button in the top right corner of the page
3. Click "Announce" in the dialog to confirm

## Check your host's status

Once the announcement is confirmed you can check if your host is visible on the network by going to [https://troubleshoot.siacentral.com](https://troubleshoot.siacentral.com/). Enter your host's net address and click "Check Host". This tool will connect to your host and notify you of any issues.
