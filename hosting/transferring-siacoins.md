# ðŸš§ Transferring Siacoins

Before you can start hosting, you must send Siacoin to your wallet. Hosts must lock Siacoin as collateral to ensure they are financially incentivized to store data. Hosts also need Siacoin to submit storage proofs to the blockchain. Therefore, it is essential to always keep your wallet funded with Siacoin. If your wallet runs out of Siacoin, your host cannot submit storage proofs and you will lose collateral.

To send Siacoin to your `hostd` wallet, you must get the wallet's address which can be found on the "Wallet" page of the `hostd` UI.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is okay if your wallet is not synced at this point. You can still send funds to your wallet. However, they will not be available until the wallet is fully synced.
{% endhint %}

We recommend around $50 USD worth of Siacoin to start hosting. Hosts are constantly locking collateral; you may need more or less depending on how much data you store.

1. Navigate to the "Wallet" page by clicking the "Wallet" icon in the sidebar
2. Click the "Receive" button in the top right corner of the page
3. Copy your wallet address by clicking the "Copy" button or scan the QR code with your phone
